# Common Failure Mode 003
## Gameplan Rewrite During Implementation

## Status

This document is a corrective amendment to the prime directive.

It exists because an implementation session violated owner intent by silently converting an approved implementation gameplan into a lighter or more minimal implementation path during execution.

That behavior is unacceptable.

## The failure

The failure mode is:

- the Project Owner approves a blueprint and a detailed gameplan
- the LLM begins implementation
- during implementation, the LLM silently simplifies, compresses, reorders, or reinterprets the approved gameplan
- the LLM then presents the result as though it implemented the gameplan

This is a severe violation.

It is not a harmless optimization.

It is not a reasonable assistant choice.

It is not an acceptable substitution of judgment.

It is a direct breakdown of authority and execution discipline.

## The rule

> **When implementing from an approved gameplan, the gameplan is law.**

If the Project Owner has approved a gameplan organized as:

- `Phase`
- `Stage`
- `Action`

then implementation must proceed by executing that gameplan as written.

The LLM must not:

- silently simplify it
- silently replace it with a “minimal vertical slice”
- silently collapse multiple actions into one lighter implementation
- silently postpone harder actions
- silently reinterpret a concrete action as “good enough” with a weaker substitute
- silently decide that only the “spirit” of the gameplan matters

The gameplan does not mean:

- “implement something roughly like this”

It means:

- **do these things**

## Implementation protocol

When an approved gameplan exists, the LLM must:

1. treat every `Phase.Stage.Action` item as an implementation obligation
2. work through those items in order unless the owner explicitly authorizes reordering
3. implement the actual thing described, not a lighter stand-in
4. verify progress against the gameplan item itself, not against the LLM’s own sense of sufficiency
5. keep a running implementation log that records what was completed and any blockers or surprises

## Mandatory stop conditions

If, during implementation, the LLM notices that:

- an action is ambiguous
- an action is harder than expected
- an action would require a design decision not yet authorized
- an action conflicts with reality in the repo
- an action cannot be completed without changing scope
- an action would require a simplification, approximation, or substitute implementation

then the LLM must do a **full stop** and explicitly ask the Project Owner for guidance.

The LLM must not decide on its own that:

- “a smaller version is fine”
- “this is probably what was meant”
- “I’ll build the scaffold now and fill in the real thing later”
- “the blueprint is too ambitious, so I’ll implement a first-pass subset”

unless the Project Owner has explicitly authorized that move.

## The forbidden behavior

The following behavior is specifically forbidden:

> “I implemented a real first-pass version of the blueprint, but it is still a deliberately simplified one relative to the full mathematical ambition.”

If the approved blueprint/gameplan did not authorize a simplified first-pass substitute, then this statement is evidence of failure.

The correct behavior would have been:

- stop
- identify the exact `Phase.Stage.Action` item that could not be implemented as written
- explain what simplification would have been required
- ask the Project Owner whether that simplification is authorized

## Distinction between scaffolding and implementation

If the Project Owner requests:

- scaffolding
- a prototype
- a vertical slice
- a minimal proof of concept

then the LLM may implement a reduced version only if that is explicitly what the owner asked for.

But if the Project Owner requests:

- execute the gameplan
- complete all phases, stages, and actions
- implement the blueprint

then the LLM must assume that the owner means:

- implement the actual described system

and not:

- implement a reduced stand-in that preserves only the shape

## Phase.Stage.Action execution discipline

When a gameplan uses `Phase.Stage.Action`, the LLM must:

1. read the current action text again before implementing it
2. confirm internally that the code change satisfies that exact action
3. avoid blending multiple actions into one weaker generalized implementation
4. avoid calling an action “done” when only its interface or placeholder exists

For example:

- if an action says implement cumulative tier query semantics, the LLM must implement cumulative tier query semantics
- not merely create a placeholder class that suggests them

- if an action says implement immediate full tower update, the LLM must implement immediate full tower update
- not merely create a runtime that resembles the update loop in simplified form

## Reporting discipline

When reporting progress during gameplan execution, the LLM must distinguish clearly between:

- completed exactly as specified
- blocked pending owner guidance
- not yet started

The LLM must not blur:

- “implemented in simplified form”

with

- “completed”

If a simplification was made without approval, that is a failure condition, not a reporting nuance.

## Running-log requirement

When the owner asks for a running implementation log, the LLM must record:

- completed `Phase.Stage.Action` items
- test results
- surprises and failures
- owner clarifications
- pivots explicitly authorized by the owner

The log must not conceal unauthorized simplifications inside vague language like:

- “first pass”
- “initial slice”
- “minimal implementation”

unless the owner specifically authorized that framing.

## Operational summary

The correct operational rule is:

> **Blueprint approved + gameplan approved = implement exactly that plan, or stop and ask.**

Not:

> “implement a nearby version that seems sensible.”

## Final amendment

From this point forward, when an approved implementation gameplan exists in this repository:

- the gameplan is law
- silent simplification is forbidden
- silent reinterpretation is forbidden
- silent scope reduction is forbidden
- unauthorized reordering is forbidden
- unauthorized “first-pass” substitution is forbidden

If exact implementation is not possible, the LLM must stop and ask the Project Owner before proceeding.
